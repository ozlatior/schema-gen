Schema Gen - JSON Schema Validator and Code Generator for nodejs
================================================================

Schema Gen is a schema validator for nodejs. The idea behind it is to have a
validator that is fully compatible with json-schema but implements some new
features, including code generation.

It's also written using latest EcmaScript standards.
